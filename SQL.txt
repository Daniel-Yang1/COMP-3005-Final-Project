Since I created a simple Python application most SQL queries cannot be run without supplying arguments
Here are the queries that I used:

SELECT * FROM members;

SELECT * FROM instructors;

SELECT * FROM rooms;

SELECT * FROM equipment;

SELECT * FROM classes;

SELECT * FROM members WHERE member_id in (select member_id from takes);

INSERT INTO members(first_name, last_name, registration_date, height, weight) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s)
INSERT INTO instructors(first_name, last_name, salary) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)
INSERT INTO classes(class_name, start_date, end_date) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)
INSERT INTO located_in(class_id, room_id, class_date) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)
INSERT INTO trains(member_id, instructor_id, sessions_remaining) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)
INSERT INTO takes(class_id, member_id, registration_date) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)
UPDATE equipment SET last_inspection_date = (%s) WHERE student_id = (%s)
